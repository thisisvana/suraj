  <p>A wedding takes months to plan, as you make sure that everything falls into place and nothing is forgotten. After all that work, you should be able to enjoy your reception and not have to worry about what the DJ is doing.
We make sure to get as many details from you as possible so you can spend your time visiting with your family and friends. We will ask you the kinds of music you would like to hear <strong>in advance</strong> and make sure things are ready to go before your guests arrive. During the reception, we work hard to read the crowd and play songs they enjoy. We are very approachable and play as many requests as possible.</p>

        <h4>tips for choosing a dj</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Rates for the DJ industry vary greatly, ranging from $350.00 to $3,500.00 with an average of $1,200.00 for a 4 hour booking.</li>
          <li>A full-service disc jockey company will normally invest 12 to 30 hours to your special event but it may appear that you are only paying for "4 hours". Consultations, preparation, transportation, set-up and tear-down, and other business related endeavors add up to the overall success of your special occasion.</li>
          <li>Many Brides and Grooms ask about price 1st because they’ve never hired a DJ before and they’re not sure what to base their decision on. An important thing to know is that a DJ is not a commodity, there is a big difference in the quality between different DJs.</li>
          <li>If you’re checking around, you’re going to hear a lot of different rates, some probably more than ours and some for less, let me ask you this, who makes or breaks your party? Your DJ should be someone you TRUST, and there is a reason our company is called Trustworthy Music!</li>
